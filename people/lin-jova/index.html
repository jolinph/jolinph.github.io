              <p class="centered">Lin Jova was the founder &amp; current Emperor of Jolinph.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>外貌 | Appearance</h4>
            <p>Jova is of a rather short stature, of normal build, and of East Asian features (i.e. monolid, small nose,
              etc.). He has deep, brown eyes that light once the world around him does, as well as long, straight, black
              hair.</p>
            <h4>性格 | Personality</h4>
            <p>On the surface, Jova appears to be a calm &amp; calculating ruler that cares for his people. In reality
              however, he is easily stressed and cannot focus when so. Nevertheless, when he is calm, he becomes
              incredibly productive, and he does, in fact, care for his people.</p>
            <p>Jova has demonstrated himself to be extremely dedicated to his work, refraining from extravagance and
              being rather frugal for someone of his position. He can become worried if he feels as if he isn't doing
              enough for his country. As for other countries, he often views them as inferior to Jolinph, holding strong
              nationalistic sentiment for the nation he founded and currently rules over.</p>
            <h4>关系 | Relationships</h4>
            <ul class="plain-list">
              <li><strong>Boren Young</strong> — Although originally close, Jova would begin shifting away from Young
                after his resignation, as it damaged the reputation of the whole of Jolinph</li>
              <li><strong>Jackson Darrall</strong> — Never really good friends, but still partners nonetheless; helped
                build the beginnings of Jolinph together though relationship now close to non-existent</li>
              <li><strong>Isain Winters</strong> — Third prime minister of Jolinph whom Jova was not very close to, they
                remain in contact to this day though rarely interact with one another</li>
              <li><strong>Frederick Manes</strong> — Was Jova's teacher, but the roles eventually flipped when Jolinph
                was formed; were good partners</li>
              <li><strong>Carl Notan</strong> — Fourth &amp; most hated emperor of Jolinph for his part in the nuking of
                Jolinph; there is absolutely zero contact between the two now</li>
              <li><strong>Luke Vellum</strong> — Knows Jova personally and still communicates with him regularly; has
                introduced multiple acts to reform Jolinph</li>
              <li><strong>Lucas Kitner</strong> — Once very close, building creative new infrastructure, now still on
                good terms but not as well due to disagreement over the issue of free speech</li>
              <li><strong>Al-Gana Kamal</strong> — Fifth &amp; current prime minister of Jolinph whom Jova is on good
                terms with</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>历史 | History</h4>
            <h5>Early Life</h5>
            <p>Lin Jova was born on December 15th, 1996. He would be born to two peasant farmers, though rather affluent
              ones at that, being able to send Jova (their only child) to school. He would befriend Frederick Manes, a
              teacher, there.</p>
            <h5>First Steps</h5>
            <p>Jova's parents would later become merchants, allowing Jova to go to a prestigious academy in the USA.
              There he would be inspired by Yunia, a fictional country set to be on Mars. He would return to his
              homeland with renewed passion to start, not just a country, but a whole nation.</p>
            <h5>Creation of a Nation (2019)</h5>
            <p>In 2019, on January 1st, Jova would officially found Jolinph (right on the new year). Of course, it was
              nothing but a proclamation at first — but Jova would gather all the people he knew to recruit more. As
              they expanded their land, infrastructure, and member size, Jolinph could finally be truly called a nation
              on August 7th, with the founding of St. Jolisburg (the capital).</p>
            <h5>The Kingdom (2019–2021)</h5>
            <p>Jova would be a popular king who led Jolinph through the War of the First Coalition, War of Independence,
              and War of the Second Coalition during this time. His popularity would dip when he escaped to the US
              during Jolinph's occupation. However, his reputation would shift back even greater than it was before
              after massively expanding Jolinph's borders to encompass all of the Jolinese Isles. Unfortunately, this
              grand conquest would lead to massive death &amp; resource consumption, as well as many new peoples under a
              new domain who seeked greater representation. Thus, a Republic was soon created.</p>
            <h5>Republic Days (2021–2022)</h5>
            <p>During the Republic Days, Jova's power would be merely ceremonial. Boren Young, Jackson Darrall, and
              Isain Winters (in chronological order) would all be prime ministers during his kingship, and they would
              hold the actual power. He oversaw the First &amp; Second Distopiyan-Jolinese War during this time.</p>
            <p>He would be the only king, as in 2023 he would transition Jolinph into an empire.</p>
            <h5>Empire (2023)</h5>
            <p>Jova's power would go a full 180 from the Republic Days, as he now held all the power in Jolinph as an
              absolute monarch. This period saw the greatest growth in Jolinph's population, wealth, and power, but at a
              cost. Censorship, extreme security, and controlled media marked not just his reign but of all the Empire's
              days. Nevertheless, the people did not care long as they lived well. Jova would oversee the
              Jolinese-Germanic War during this time and also the Feferant terrorist attacks that caused him to step
              down. Frederick Manes would then take over.</p>
            <h5>Revival (2024–2025)</h5>
            <p>Now the fifth &amp; current emperor of Jolinph who has overseen massive growth since the revival, Jova
              was the head architect behind Jolinph's military &amp; government reformation, immigration policy change,
              and diplomacy. Two prime ministers have served during his reign, being Lucas Kitner (for two terms) &amp;
              Al-Gana Kamal.</p>
