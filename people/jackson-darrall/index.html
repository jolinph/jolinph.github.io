                  Jackson Darrall was the second &amp; longest-serving prime minister, and also the third &amp; shortest-reigning emperor.
                </p>
              </div>
              <h4>外貌 | Appearance</h4>
              <p>
                Darrall is of an above average stature, with prominent freckles across his cheeks. He has a smaller nose that causes his
                glasses to often fall down. He has brown hair that fluctuates between periods of being long &amp; short.
              </p>
              <h4>性格 | Personality</h4>
              <p>
                On the surface, Darrall is a well-mannered, mature, and intelligent individual who helped drive Jolinph into its own mature
                state. He has been described as having a sense of humor and an interest in history.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, below the façade, Darrall can be rather selfish, and one of whom doesn't take much to anger. This is not
                necessarily a bad thing however, as this has led to Darrall's passion for certain projects, and his insistence on having
                some card to play in even the most dire situations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Darrall no longer associates himself with Jolinph, seeing it as a failed state, proven when it was nuked off the face of the
                earth. Upon hearing of the revival, he came back to see what has changed, but would be met by mobs. Angered, and never
                wanting to be there in the first place, Darrall migrated to the US where he stays now.
              </p>
              <h4>关系 | Relationships</h4>
              <ul class="plain-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Lin Jova</strong> — Never really good friends, but still partners nonetheless; helped build the beginnings of
                  Jolinph together though relationship now close to non-existent
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Boren Young</strong> — From enemies to lovers, Darrall would form a close bond with Young after he handed his
                  position over to him; they continue to be in contact to this day
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Nikio Washing</strong> — Met on good terms, almost immediately understanding each other; Darrall would come to
                  betray Jolinph for Washing, but eventually returned to Jolinph before leaving again
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Isain Winters</strong> — Darrall's successor, kicking him out of office; naturally, they aren't on good terms,
                  especially considering the fight between the two for the position of prime minister was a close fought one that toppled
                  Darrall's multiple consecutive terms
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Frederick Manes</strong> — A close advisor of Darrall, their relationship was at its peak when Manes handed the
                  role of emperor over to him; Manes is the only Jolinese Darrall still mourns
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Carl Notan</strong> — A good friend of Darrall he met in school; Darrall would choose him to be the next emperor
                  after quickly losing interest
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>历史 | History</h4>
              <h5>Early Life</h5>
              <p>
                Born into an upper-class family in the Unified States of America, both of his parents worked in medicine. Pressured to
                follow in their footsteps, Darrall was put through harsh lessons. Despite eventually becoming a doctor, he would be heavily
                dissatisfied with this way of life — often witnessing the deaths of many patients. He would abandon his parents' plan and
                flee to Jolinph, a shining light of opportunity in his eyes.
              </p>
              <h5>First Steps</h5>
              <p>
                Arriving in Jolinph, he would be provided a government job working in a hospital. However, that's exactly what he was trying
                to escape from. Thus, government officials decided to make him a governor, and from there he would rise through the ranks
                into Jolinph's royal court. However, it wasn't until the Republic was formed that Darrall became prime minister.
              </p>
              <h5>Prime Minister of Jolinph</h5>
              <p>
                Originally losing to Young in an election, he would resign after not even a fortnight, giving the position to Darrall.
                Serving as prime minister, he would bring about great industrialization efforts, transforming Jolinph into a modern state
                almost rivaling that of Distopiya.
              </p>
              <h5>Betrayal &amp; Exile</h5>
              <p>
                However, it would be found it Darrall had joined the side of the Distopiyans after the First Distopiyan-Jolinese War,
                becoming disillusioned with the increasing control the 'ceremonial' king Jova began to have following wartime. After losing
                an election to Winters, Distopiya would attempt to reinstate him into power, revealing the whole ordeal. After another war
                with Distopiya, many called for Darrall's execution. However, Jova was moderate, and decided to just exile him instead.
              </p>
              <h5>Second Emperor</h5>
              <p>
                After a year of exile, Darrall would return back to the Jolinese government, though now only in local administration.
                However, after the turbulent times of post-Jova Jolinph, Darrall would find himself as the new emperor of Jolinph. This
                position would be short-lived, however, as parliament would impeach him due to his anti-war rhetoric while the Final War was
                approaching.
              </p>
              <h5>Nuking</h5>
              <p>
                Residing in the outskirts of St. Jolisburg at the time, Darrall would survive but suffer severe burns &amp; brain damage
                following the nuking. He has since lost most of his memory regarding Jolinph, and is described as being more toxic than
                before. Best wishes for his recovery.
