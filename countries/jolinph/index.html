              <p class="centered">The Empire of Jolinph, commonly known as Jolinph, is a country located in Northwestern
                Ozho off the coast of the continental mainland. Jolinph does not share a land border with any country,
                though it does share naval borders with the Unified States & Ozhon Union</p>

            <h2>词源 | Etymology</h2>
            <p>The name Jolinph comes from the mythological founder of Jolinph, St. Jolis.</p>
            <h2>历史 | History</h2>
            <h3>Kingdom</h3>
            <p>The first political form of the Jolinese state, established by Lin Jova on January 1st, 2019, under a
              divine narrative of prophecy & unity. It saw the codification of the Jovan Code, unification of the
              Jolinese Isles, and rapid early growth with the founding of St. Jolisburg. However, the kingdom faced
              early trials including barbarian invasions, the COVID outbreak, and a devastating defeat in the War of the
              First Coalition, which led to Jova’s temporary exile. Popular resistance led to the Jolinese War of
              Independence and the collapse of Coalition occupation. Despite military success, internal dissent over
              autocratic rule and the desire for democratic reforms led to the peaceful dissolution of the monarchy and
              the founding of the republic in 2021.</p>
            <h3>Republic</h3>
            <p>Proclaimed on March 21st, 2021, transitioning from monarchy to a constitutional system with an elected
              prime minister and a symbolic monarch. After a brief term by Boren Young, Jackson Darrall and later Isain
              Winters led the republic through turbulent times. Jolinph became more open to immigration and
              international alliances, but these decisions sparked tensions—particularly with the militaristic nation of
              Distopiya—leading to two successive wars. While the first ended in uneasy peace, the second revealed
              Darrall’s betrayal and resulted in his exile. Prime Minister Winters spearheaded military innovations and
              intelligence operations, culminating in a joint victory with Germania over Distopiya. However, growing
              fears of foreign entanglement and internal political discourse led Jova to declare himself emperor on
              January 1st, 2022, ending the republican experiment.</p>
            <h3>Empire</h3>
            <p>Established on January 1st, 2022, with Jova assuming full autocratic control as Emperor, marking an era
              of rapid expansion, immigration, economic growth, and militarization. Tensions with the New Germanic Order
              escalated into the Jolinese-Germanic War, the bloodiest in Jolinese history, resulting in massive
              casualties but ending in a symbolic victory for Jolinph. Soon after, a wave of domestic terror attacks by
              the international terrorist Feferen Anter led to instability and Jova’s abdication. His successor,
              Frederick Manes, proved ineffective, and Jackson Darrall returned to power amidst rising global tensions.
              The emergence of the Holy Mercutian Empire sparked the Final War, pitting Jolinph and its allies against a
              technologically advanced, nuclear-capable aggressor: Mercutia. Despite strong resistance and global
              coordination, Jolinph was ultimately devastated by a Mercutian nuclear strike on April 27, 2023,
              effectively ending the Empire and fragmenting the nation into chaos.</p>
            <h3>Revival (2024–)</h3>
            <p>In late 2024, Jolinph would be revived — its culture & people restored. Millions flocked to their banner,
              and a majority of Jolinph's population would be recovered. Still smaller than it originally was, the new
              Jolinph aims for a peaceful world — focusing on cultural & economic development.</p>

            <h2>政治 | Politics</h2>
            <h3>Government</h3>
            <p>Jolinph is a constitutional diarchy split into two branches: the imperial & legislative. At the head of
              the imperial branch is the Emperor. The Premier leads the legislative branch, of which is made up of
              ministry heads (e.g. Ministry of Defense, Ministry of the Interior, etc.). Mandarin is the term used to
              refer to any government official in the legislative branch. Visorin act as an ethics committee for the
              government, reviewing proposals & actions independently. The courts also act independently of the
              government, though still follow the National Law. The ███ Court (name can only be heard by TWK) is the
              highest court, and has the ability to change the National Law.</p>
            <p>There are no prefectures, provinces, or anything of the sort. All power is centralized with no federal
              system in place. However, the central authority is rather decentralized with various ministries & agencies
              dealing with their respective matters — though all ultimately still subservient to the diarchs.</p>
            <h3>Foreign Relations</h3>
            <ul class="plain-list">
              <li><strong>Unified States of America</strong> — Has soured in recent years, but still relatively
                friendly; immigration between the two nations is one of the highest in the world</li>
              <li><strong>Distopiya</strong> — Much improved historically, frequent trade & travel between the two
                nations</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>人口统计 | Demographics</h2>
            <p>Jolinph is a multicultural state with open borders. A majority of the population is white, but Asians
              have a large minority presence. Middle Eastern immigration has also seen a recent spike, increasing
              Islamic influence in the nation.</p>
            <h2>文化 | Culture</h2>
            <p>Jolinph has a very developed culture in regard to the length of their history. Although geographically
              close to Ozho, Jolinese culture features more elements from the Orient, likely because a large portion of
              the island's inhabitants are the descendants of Siberians traveling from Greenland.</p>

            <p>Jolinese people are especially proud of their futuristic designs, of which have led to the modern
              minimalist aesthetic often seen online (though Jolinph has a slightly different design from those).
              Besides that, their folk lore, music, and food are all world-renown, and many non-Jolinese still
              participate in traditional Jolinese religious customs just for the cultural value.</p>
