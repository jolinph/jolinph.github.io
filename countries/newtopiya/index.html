              <p class="centered">The Republic of Newtopiya arises from the ashes of the Grand Distopiyan State. Once a
                military dictatorship, Newtopiya has transformed into one of the most democratic nations in the world —
                though now far less powerful. It comprises of only one city, Newtopiya, and is fully surrounded by the
                Ozhon Union.</p>
            </div>
            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>With the country of Distopiya being so ancient, the way that they got their name is colluded in mystery.
              It most likely originates from the saying 'this toe pie,' which is saying that refers to strength through
              trickery.</p>
            <p>Some people believe that the name comes from the word 'Dystopia,' but that's completely false. It's a
              major point of contention and can often be regarded as derogatory towards Distopiyans.</p>
            <p>Newtopia is the new official name of this nation, but many still refer to it as Distopiya. Although the
              government tries to move on from its old name as much as possible — it is near impossible to change,
              having been 'Distopiya' for centuries.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of Distopiya goes back all the way to early medieval times. Back then, the country was lead
              by a monarch, and for a many years, all was fine. Their economy was fixated on agriculture and farming
              which stumped the countries flow of income. In 2009, the discovery of massive ore deposits on the south
              bank of Distopiya made the economy do a complete change of tactics. Going from farming to mining was
              incredibly drastic for the people, and even though it would allow the country to prosper, people were
              angry at the idea of leaving their farms. After many years of hard labor in the mines, they started to
              realize that even with the new flow of income, their lives never changed. Tensions started to grow, and
              protests started to happen. On August 14, 2011, the disappearance of Brenden Challice, a famous denouncer
              of the monarch sparked massive riots in the streets of Distopiya. People began to arm themselves with
              weaponry acquired from their time in the military to fight against their oppressive government. A keystone
              figure in the now revolution, was Nikio Washing. Nikio was a previous general in the army, and used his
              skills as a commander to take over the capital city. Once everything settled down, Nikio declared himself
              the brand new ruler of Distopiya. The new Grand Distopiyan State would be involved in various wars with
              Jolinph, Germania, and Frallia before being fully conquered by Mercutia during the Final War. Following
              Mercutia's collapse, most of Distopiya was incorporated into the Ozhon Union, but the capital remained its
              own sovereign state.</p>
            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p>Distopiya's geography was a vast landscape full of different temperatures and climates. The most commonly
              found in Distopiya were flat plains, dotted with trees and rivers. Near the northeastern part of the
              country then lay the Gorjge mountain range. Providing not only valuable resources, but natural protection
              from hostile countries that may reside to the east of the range also. A defining feature of Distopiya is
              its amazing and nutrient rich soil, which yields amazing and almost unbelievable results for any crops
              that people may wish to grow. The annual rainfall for Distopiya ranges from around 760-840 milimeters of
              rainfall every single year.</p>
            <h2>Politics</h2>
            <h3>Government</h3>
            <p>Distopiya is a representative republic, with different political parties vying for the position of
              president — of which is voted upon by the people. Unlike similar systems, the party is at the head of the
              election, and not any single individual.</p>
            <h3>Historically</h3>
            <p>Originally the Kingdom of Distopiya headed by a monarch, then the Grand Distopiyan State headed by Nikio
              Washing (a military general). Both were hereditary dictatorships, though the latter never got past a
              single generation of leaders.</p>
            <h3>Foreign Relations</h3>
            <ul class="plain-list">
              <li><strong>Jolinph</strong> — Allies at first, but later became bitter enemies; now allies again, closer
                than ever as one of three states in Ozho not incorporated into the Union</li>
              <li><strong>Germania</strong> — Near total hostility during the Distopiyan days; now, most Newtopiyans no
                longer see Germanics as enemies, adopting a neutral attitude</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Military</h3>
            <p>One of Distopiya's main focuses, is their military. Everyone is required to serve in the military for at
              least two years, and being a highly militaristic country, they naturally have a strong army. Their army
              consists of 8 divisions of soldiers, and 6 tank divisions; which consisted of around 850,000 men and 2,000
              tanks and vehicles. Their biggest flaw is their air force and navy, as they only have around 300 aerial
              vehicles and 3 ships on the water. Because almost all resources go to the military, their infrastructure
              back at home is incredibly old; which means it could become vulnerable to any type of attack.</p>
            <h3>Military Inventions</h3>
            <p>Even though the modern Distopiya military may be severely lacking, they were known to be quite the
              inventors back in the day. An extremely famous piece of equipment that many armies still use today is the
              hand grenade, and it was popularized in the First Distopiyan-Jolinese War due to its efficiency.</p>
            <h2>Demographics</h2>
            <p>Distopiya is a mostly white country. They hold many different types of races but most of them aren't very
              involved with the country. While it currently is a white country, the birthrate is low, and Asians could
              overtake the population of Distopiya in a couple decades.</p>
            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>The culture of Distopiya is extremely interesting, as it mostly consists of food and the military. Guns
              are a core part of the culture in Distopiya, and it is looked upon as positive to own one. However, the
              Newtopiyan government has recently became stricter on gun control. Food also has a major part of the
              culture in Distopiya, as a lot of spices and dishes actually originate from this country. Many people can
              correlate Distopiya with tasty and enjoyable meals that they have tried.</p>
